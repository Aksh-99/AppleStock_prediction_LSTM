# Stock Prediction using Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Model (LSTM and Q-learning)

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python implementation of a hybrid reinforcement learning model for stock price prediction, combining Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) with Q-learning.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

- `keras`
- `tensorflow`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install keras tensorflow pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
````
## Data

The model uses historical stock price data in CSV format. The CSV file should have a column named "Close" which contains the closing prices of the stock.

## Usage

1. Load the historical stock price data from a CSV file.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/data.csv")
```
## Preprocess the data.
```python
df1 = df.reset_index()['Close']
```
## Scale the data.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
df1 = scaler.fit_transform(np.array(df1).reshape(-1, 1))
```
## Train the Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Model

To train the hybrid reinforcement learning model, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and modules.

```python
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import numpy as np
import random
from collections import deque
```
2. Create the agent.
```python
class Agent:
```
3. Define the basic functions needed for training.
```python
def formatPrice(n):
    # ...

def getStockDataVec(key):
    # ...

def sigmoid(x):
    # ...

def getState(data, t, n):
    # ...
```
4. Train the agent.
For detailed steps and code, refer to the provided Python file.

## Evaluate the Model

To evaluate the model, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model.

```python
from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("path/to/your/model")
```
Test the model with new data and calculate the profit/loss.
# Techniques for Predicting Stock Prices

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Time Series Models, such as ARIMA
Time series models are used for analyzing time-ordered data points. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular time series forecasting model that uses past values and past errors to predict future values.

## LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies. It is particularly useful for predicting sequences of data, such as stock prices.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes, and the goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

# What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. It is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), consisting of an environment, a set of actions, and rewards.

# What is Q-learning?

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn the quality of actions, denoting the total expected rewards an agent can get, starting from a state and taking an action. It helps the agent to find the best action from a given state by providing a function that estimates the reward. In the context of stock trading, Q-learning can be used to maximize the profit by choosing the best action (buy, sell, or hold) in each state of the market.
